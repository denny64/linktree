# The Problem
We have three new link types for our users profile pages, such as https://linktr.ee/guardian

1. Classic
	- Accepts a single URL.
	- Opens the URL in a new tab.

2. Music Player 
	- On click, the link type displays a set of links to music streaming platforms where you can find the song.
	- Clicking on an element inside of the Music Link will open an audio player for that song, powered by that platform.
	- Clicking on the logo of the platform of an element will take you to that song, in that platform.

3. Shows List
	- On click, the link type displays a list of links to upcoming events.
	- Clicking on an upcoming event will navigate to the event in SongKick.
	
You are required to create the front end components for the new features as per the assets provided via Zeplin below (Front End Assets)

## Design Considerations
  - All links are globally themed by the users preferences (usually available via API e.g `{background_color: "rebeccapurple", text_color:  "palegoldenrod" }`).
  - All links invert colour on hover.
  
## Your Solution

- Consider re-usability through composition.


## Rules & Tips
- Use of ReactJS will be looked upon favourably.
- You cannot connect to a real world API - mock any data sets that you require.
- @todo comments are encouraged. You aren't expected to complete the challenge, but how you design your solution and your ideas for the future are important.
- Commit your work and submit Pull Requests as you would in real life.

## Front End Assets
A sketch file is available within this repository, and an online version of the asset is available at Zeplin.
